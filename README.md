# mcgutils

This repository contains a collection of useful utilities mostly for ray-tracing purposes. See [my webpage](https://www.artansalihu.com/) or [utilities page](https://mcg-deep-wrt.netlify.app/deep-wrt/utilities/) for other details.

## Tools

The following tools are included in this repository:

- [MCGOsmHelperNXX](mcgosmhelpernxx/): Load geo-data from the OSM when considering a greater geographical area (e.g. a city).
- [MCGOsmHelperBlend](mcgosmhelperblend/): Load geo-data from the OSM from Blender.
- [MCGUncertaintyBasic](mcguncertaintybasic/): Uncertainty modelling (basic example). Useful for modelling time-varying environemtns in Blender.
- [MCGRemcomRis](mcgremcomris/): Model, simulate, read, and analyse programatically in Remcom WI. Useful for automating simulations and analysis, like radiation pattern for RIS.
- [MCGOSMHelper](mcgosmhelper/): Load geo-data from the OSM when considering a smaller geographical area (e.g. a building).
- [MCGConverterStl2Skp](mcgconverterstl2skp/): Convert bulk STLs to SKPs.

## Usage

Follow the instructions provided in the tool's README.
